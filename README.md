## Overview

The `api-eureka-service` is a demo microservice that acts as a service registry using Netflix Eureka. It allows microservices to register themselves at runtime as they come up in the system and to discover other registered services for communication.

## Features

- Service registration and discovery.
- Built-in fault tolerance.
- Load balancing with Ribbon.
- Easy integration with Spring Boot applications.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Service Discovery**: Netflix Eureka
- **Build Tool**: Maven

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jnuwan/api-eureka-service.git
   cd api-eureka-service
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Configure your Eureka server settings in `application.properties`.

### Running the Application

To run the application locally, use the following command:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the Eureka server, and you can access the Eureka dashboard at `http://localhost:8761`.

## Usage

Once the Eureka server is running, other microservices can register with it by configuring their `application.properties` to point to the Eureka server. Below is an example configuration for a client microservice:

```properties
spring.application.name=client-service
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
```
